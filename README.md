# magic-on-canvas

###### Using my skills in canvas HTML element and JavaScript I am creating Generative Art which I build with particle system algorithm.

###### This is art that takes control of itself, molds and transforms as a user would move mouse across page, then beautiful patterns of colourful art will transform with it. :art:

# Art that is controlled by the machine itself

###### This will decide how it will visually look on the page.

### The effect will be growing plant that travels in any direction, constantly growing.
